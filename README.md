This repository contains the code to develop a Realtime deep learning model that detects whether the driver is falling or about to fall asleep while driving. 
The code contains a CNN model built from scratch without the use of libraries and a VGG16, a basic CNN model by using the inbuilt libraries. VGG 16 performed the best with 96% accuracy.
